Weather app project for TheOdinProject.
Vanilla JS, CSS, HTML + Webpack. Used external npm library date fns for date formatting.
This project was done to get familiar with the idea of Promises and fetching data from API (OpenWeather in this case).

Ideas for future: add auto location and local storage.
